    "- I am trying to get overall correlations and identify when the shift happened or started to happen in the ecosystems. I have the invertebrate data, the kelp data, and now the water temp data. Analysis 5 and 6 are my current projects. I need to be able to compare the ecological parameters I have calculated and merged together into one dataframe in Analysis 2/Analysis 6, with the counts of species of interest (purp urchins, red abalone, and sunflower stars/sea stars), and water temperature, all over time. I'm thinking that certain grouping methods with those .join, .merge..., .stack, etc functions will come in handy with some forward filling for dates. \n",
    "- The dataframes are ```eco_std```, ```invert_rcca_group```, ```kelp_rcca_group```, and ```sst_df``` and ```sst_anomaly_df``` , which I have exported as csv's from their original notebooks (Analyses: 2, 1, 2, 5, and 5, respectively) into Analysis 6 for easier purusal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Humboldt Sci-Diving Data:\n",
    "- What are some recommendations for the final function that will clean the data? I already have a lot of functions made that I will use, like for converting the strings to floats and matching the diver names to any nicknames that might have been written. But let me know if you see anything that I am missing!"
